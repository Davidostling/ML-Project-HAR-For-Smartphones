# ML Project, HAR for smartphones
Was part of a three-person team that developed a machine learning model for an adaptive pedometer using _human activity recognition (HAR)_. We employed both supervised learning methods such as _principal component analysis (PCA)_ and _K-best_ and unsupervised learning methods such as _naive bayes, K-nearest neighbors (KNN)_, and _linear discriminant analysis (LDA)_ to solve multi-classification problems with a dataset collected through sensors and motion activity.
